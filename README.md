# Heise Simulator Keyboard Layout for Typing Rubik's Cube Algs.
Idea and Implementation by Lucas Garron, March 7, 2010

Version 1.1

## ABOUT
This Mac OSX "keyboard layout" allows you to type Rubik's Cube algs using the fabulous controls invented by Ryan Heise and popularized at http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed.html
Cmd-Shortcuts will work as normal.

Made with [Ukulele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=ukelele).

## INSTALLATION
Install the layout by copying "HeiseSimulator.keylayout" and "HeiseSimulator.icns" to `/Library/Keyboard` Layouts or to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` (create one of them if they don't exist).
You may need to log out of OS X and log in again before it will be available; then use System Preferences / Language & Text / Input Sources to enable it. It should now be an option from the keyboard layout icon in the upper right of the screen. Please note the layout may not work on currently running programs until they are relaunched.
